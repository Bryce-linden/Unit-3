        <h3>The data displayed is taken from Montana's 2020 census, showing the counties of 3 of its 6 regions: Glacier Country, Southwest Montana, and Yellowstone Country. As one cycles through the different attributes, 
            one will gain a better understanding of the regions of future growth as well as economic stagnation in Western Montana.  </h3>
        <h4>Counties in Southwest Montana, particularily Gallatin and Madison counties, carry a high per capita income, but it is the major cities of Missoula and Bozeman, located in Missoula and Gallatin counties, respectively, that dwarf all other counties in GDP.</h4>
